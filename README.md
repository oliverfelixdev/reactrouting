## React Routing Project

This repository demonstrates the fundamentals of React Routing, enabling you to create dynamic and navigable single-page applications (SPAs). React Router is a powerful library that helps manage navigation and rendering of components in your React app based on the URL.

### What You'll Learn
- Setting up routes for your application using `react-router-dom`.
- Creating dynamic routes and nested routing.
- Leveraging `Link`, `NavLink`, and programmatic navigation for seamless user experiences.
- Protecting routes with authentication or role-based access.

### Key Features
- **React + Vite**: Optimized development and build process.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for responsive design.
- **ESLint**: Ensures code consistency and quality.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of React Routing.
